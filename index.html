			<h3>A Good Article about Starting Out</h3>
			<p>The diagram above comes from <a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard">Viking Code School Blog.</a> There's a solid article on there about what it's really like to learn to code, and the author offers some good tips on what every beginner needs to know about the journey into coding.</p>

		<h1>The Dom Tree</h1>
		<h3>Document Object Model</h3>
		<img src="img/domtree.jpg" id="confidence" />
		<p>Think of the DOM as a hierarchy of tags. This comes into play later when you start using JavaScript or CSS.</p>

		<!--IDs and classes-->
	<div class="ids-classes">
		<h2>CSS Fundamentals</h2>
			<h3>CSS Statements</h3>
			<p>Four main components include the following: </p>
			<ol> 
				<li><b>Declaration:</b>the statement as a whole with curly braces.</li> 
				<li><b>Selector</b>the name of the part you want to style.</li>
	    		<li><b>Property</b>properties to edit(e.g., width, height, background, etc.)</li>
	    		<li><b>Value:</b>numbers, colors, urls - things to fill in for the property. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here's a good photo to illustrate these items:</p>

			<h3>Classes - Remember to use . </h3>
			<ul> 
				<li>Classes start with . in the selector <b>.git</b></li> 
				<li>They can safely be called on multiple elements.</li>
	    		<li>Very useful, but things can get complicated quickly.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>ids - Use the #</h3>
			<ul> 
				<li>start with a pound</li>
				<li>should only be called on one element <b>#hello</b> </li> 
				<li id="cool">Cool feature - Run your app and add <b>#cool</b> to the url.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>CSS Margins & Padding</h2>
			<img src="marginsandpadding.png" id="margin-demo" >
			<h3>Margins</h3>
			<p>Margins can be tricky. Remember that it is the edge of the particular element that you're talking about. You can set the margin for divs, h's, p's, etc.</p> 

			<p id="margin-experiment">Here is a bunch of text that I'm going to mess around with. I'm going to have all of this be a chunk of text that gets moved around. </p>

			<h3>Padding</h3>
			<p>Remember that padding is inside the margins and border. You can set the margin for divs, h's, p's, etc., but you will be inside the margins.</p>
			<p id="padding-experiment">Here is a bunch of text that I'm going to mess around with. I'm going to have all of this be a chunk of text that gets moved around. </p>
